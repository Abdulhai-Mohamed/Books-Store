@*
 you maybe wonder why we need to use both layout and view start when they do same job
 layout have adventage to use the methods like renderbody while viewstart haven't it
 viewstart called automatically with every page while to call layout view you have to 
 set the property  Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml" for eaxch view.
 
 so best practice is adding this prop throw viewstart

        //Layout = "_AdminLayout";
        Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
    }
    else
    {

        Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
    }
}
